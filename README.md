## ✨ Trigger.dev Hello World

This repo is a very simple starting point for creating your Trigger.dev workflows.

Currently this repo only has a single [customEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events) trigger:

```ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  // Give your Trigger a stable ID
  id: "hello-world",
  name: "Template: Hello World",
  // Trigger on the custom event named "your.event", see https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events
  on: customEvent({
    name: "your.event",
  }),
  // The run functions gets called once per "your.event" event
  async run(event, ctx) {
    await ctx.waitFor("waiting...", { seconds: 10 });

    await ctx.logger.info("Hello world from inside trigger.dev");
  },
}).listen();
```

## 🔧 Install

You can easily create a new project interactively based on this template by running:

```sh
npx create-trigger@latest hello-world
# or
yarn create trigger hello-world
# or
pnpm create trigger@latest hello-world
```

Follow the instructions in the CLI to get up and running locally in <30s.

## 📺 Go Live

After you are happy with your campaign and deploy it live to Render.com (or some other hosting service), you can send custom events that Trigger your workflow using the [sendEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/reference/send-event) function from the `@trigger.dev/sdk`, or simply by making requests to our [`events`](https://docs.trigger.dev/api-reference/events/sendEvent) API endpoint.

Here is an example of sending the custom event to trigger the workflow contained in this repo using `fetch`:

```ts
const event = {
  name: "your.event",
  payload: {
    hello: "world",
  },
};

const response = await fetch("https://app.trigger.dev/api/v1/events", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: randomUUID(),
    event,
  }),
});
```

## ✍️ Customize

You can easily adapt this workflow to a different event relevant to your app. For example, we have a workflow that runs when a user is created and it looks like this:

```ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import * as slack from "@trigger.dev/slack";
import { z } from "zod";

new Trigger({
  id: "new-user",
  name: "New user",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "user.created",
    schema: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  }),
  async run(event, ctx) {
    const user = await prisma.user.find({
      where: { id: event.id },
    });

    await slack.postMessage("🚨", {
      channelName: "new-users",
      text: `New user signed up: ${user.email}`,
    });
  },
}).listen();
```
